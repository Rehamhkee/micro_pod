<b>about</b> <br>
micro_pod was inspired by my deep fascination with true crime stories and the impact they have on our understanding of justice and human behavior. As a lifelong enthusiast of criminal mysteries and investigative journalism, I wanted to create a platform where people could explore detailed case studies and engage in thoughtful discussions about various cases. <br>
The journey began in [august, 2024] when I started compiling research and resources about notable criminal cases. I realized that many of these stories were scattered across different sources, making it difficult for people to find comprehensive and engaging information in one place. This realization sparked the idea to build micro_pod as a centralized hub for true crime enthusiasts. <br>
